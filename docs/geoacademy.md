## FOSS4G GeoAcademy Curriculum

Thiry-five (35) FOSS4G University-level **lectures and labs** are
maintained and made available for download from the Spatial {Query} Lab
on behalf of the
[GeoAcademy](https://foss4geo.wordpress.com/ "GeoAcademy"). The lectures
focus on a vendor-agnostic set of theories and principles. The labs
focus on the use of [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org "QGIS Website"),
[GRASS](http://grass.osgeo.org/ "GRASS GIS Website"), and
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org "Inkscape Website").

The lectures and labs are aligned to the [Geospatial Technology
Competency
Model](http://www.careeronestop.org/COMPETENCYMODEL/competency-models/geospatial-technology.aspx "Geospatial Technology Competency Model")
and all labs focus on the use of Free and Open Source GIS Software
(FOSS4G).

The components of the lectures and labs are listed on this page to make
it easy to download and use. All of the labs are also available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/FOSS4GAcademy "FOSS4G Academy GitHub Repository").

*Note: The lectures are currently only viewable on line as HTML.
Downloadable source files are coming soon.*
